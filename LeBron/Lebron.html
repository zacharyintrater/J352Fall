This is a timeline of the historic NBA career of LeBron James. It includes what I consider to be the most important and noteworthy moments of LeBron's career. It spans almost 20 years, all the way from LeBron's first career game in June of of 2003, to this past season when he became the league's all time leading scorer. This timeline not only shows how accomplished LeBron's career has been, but it also conveys his incredible longevity.<br><br>
