<h1>Navient Complaint Issues</h1>

<h3>Graphs by: Zachary Intrater</h3><br>

<h5><a href="https://navient.com/" target="_blank">Navient</a> is a large financial sevices company. Like any big financial company, <a href="https://navient.com/" target="_blank">Navient</a> receives its fair share of complaints from customers. Many of these complaints have actually <a href="https://www.studentloanplanner.com/navient-lawsuit-updates/" target="_blank">resulted in lawsuits towards Navient in the past few years.</a> The complaint information and details are made public on the <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/search/?chartType=line&dateInterval=Month&dateRange=All&date_received_max=2023-11-11&date_received_min=2011-12-01&lens=Product&searchField=all&subLens=sub_product&tab=Trends" target="_blank">Consumer Financial Protection Bureauâ€™s Consumer Complaint Database</a>, which means that we are able to see which issues are causing the most complaints.</h5><br>

<h5>What I've done is look at all of the student loan complaints that have come out of Maryland and Virginia in 2023, and looked at the issues that have caused all of these complaints. I then made two pie charts (one for Maryland and one for Virginia) showing what percentage of the complaints in each of these states are caused by each of the different issues that have caused complaints. There have been three different issues which have caused complaints in Maryland in 2023, compared to five different issues which have caused complaints in Virginia in 2023.</h5>
