<h1>Personal Analysis of Commanders Season Through 4 Weeks</h1>


<p>As a 21 year old life-long Commanders fan, I can honestly say that this is objectively one of the better rosters top to bottom that I can remember this team putting out.</p>

<p>The defense is one of the more talented units in the league, with the defensive line probably being the most talented group in the league. Our safety duo is very good, and our corners are at the very least adequate. Our linebacker duo leaves a decent amount to be desired, but overall, this is a defense that easily has potential to be a top 5 unit in the league. Much of this was largely already known/expected coming into the season, however. The question marks were largely on the offensive side of the ball. And so far this season, I would argue that overall, the offense has given fans more to be excited about than to be pessimistic about.</p>

<p>The main question mark of course was on Sam Howell. Anytime you’re going into a season with a starting quarterback with just one career start, you can’t be too sure what you’re getting. And personally, I have been very happy with what I’ve seen from the young signal caller. While he’s had a few rookie mistakes (he’s not technically a rookie but he has the relative game experience of a rookie) such as forcing the ball and trying to do a little bit too much at times, I think that the positives absolutely outweigh the negatives. Between his playmaking ability, arm talent, and ability to go through reads and find the open man, I think that Washington fans can be optimistic that we may have found our guy.</p>

<p>Looking outside of the quarterback position, the offense has had some pros and cons. I would argue that the main pro has actually been the improved playcalling, with new OC Eric Bieniemy having been able to draw up route combos to create open receivers with much greater frequency than I can remember in any previous year in the Ron Rivera era. Our talented wide receiver trio has also been pretty good, with each of Terry, Jahan, and Curtis having made their presence known at points throughout the season. Brian Robinson has been impressive as well, and has further proved what a hard and strong runner he is. However, we do need to address what has been by far the main weakness of the team so far, which is the offensive line, specifically the pass blocking.</p>

<p>Coming into the season, no one expected this line to be an above average unit, but they’ve probably been even worse than anyone would have expected. For a young, developing quarterback, arguably the most important thing that he needs as far as on-field help from his teammates, is an offensive line that consistently gives him time to stand in the pocket and do his thing, and unfortunately Sam has not had this luxury in any game so far. This has been a serious problem thus far, and while I don’t think that the offensive line can realistically just start suddenly playing significantly better, I do think that the negative effects of the abysmal pass blocking can be mitigated, by both Sam and Bieniemy.</p>

<p>As bad as the offensive line has been, there have been times where Sam has made them look a little worse than they actually were, by holding onto the ball too long, and forcing his linemen to block for longer than they can reasonably be expected to. If Sam can learn to get the ball out quicker, which is a trait that is often improved as a young quarterback gets more reps and develops, then that can take a lot of pressure off of the o-line. In addition to this, if Bieniemy designs and calls more plays where Sam is getting the ball out fast, or plays where he is rolling out as opposed to staying in the pocket, then the pass-blocking weaknesses will be less pronounced, and will not hinder the offense as much as they have thus far.</p>

<p>I personally trust Bieniemy to make these adjustments, and given that this has by far been the biggest weakness of the team, fixing this issue would theoretically result in a massive improvement of the team’s overall success. Given the positives of the offense that I previously highlighted, I think that if the proper adjustments are made to help out the o-line, and if Sam continues to develop and get better, I could see this offense being a top 15 unit. Combine that with if the defense plays up to their top 5 potential, and I would argue that we’re looking at a playoff team here. Now there are a lot of “if’s” in this scenario, so I don’t mean to get ahead of myself, but I am very excited to see what this team has to offer going forward.
