<p>To many, the age-old act of drinking alcohol is a <a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/brochures-and-fact-sheets/college-drinking" target="_blank">fundamental aspect of the college experience.</a> To some, on the other hand, they see no use in alcohol and opt not to partake.<p/>


<p>With there being clear <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/healthy-drinks/drinks-to-consume-in-moderation/alcohol-full-story/" target="_blank">pros and cons to alcohol consumption,</a> I thought it could be interesting to hear and compare the perspectives of drinkers, as opposed to non-drinkers, and understand why certain people either choose to engage, or not to engage in the act.<p/>

<div margin="10px"><p>I spoke to six college students - three who do consume alcohol on at least a somewhat regular basis, and three who do not drink at all, in order to compare the different rationales.<p/></div>

<p>One of the non-drinkers, junior civil engineering major Ishan Goswami, shared that his original motivation for not drinking was fear of his parents finding out.<p/>

<p>“I have really strict Indian parents, and so when some of my friends started drinking for the first time, I was too scared that my parents would somehow find out and get mad,” Goswami said. “And then once I initially made that decision to not drink, I’ve just never really been motivated to change my mind since then and start drinking.”<p/>

<p>For junior biological sciences major Manny Sachs-Kohen, his decision to not drink is largely due to his parents instilling in him from a young age how bad alcohol is for you.</p>

<p>“Neither of my parents drink, and I’m pretty sure they have some family whose health has been affected by alcohol, so they always made sure to hammer into me how bad alcohol is for you, and I guess they did a good job, cause I’ve never drank and now I kinda see it as a value of mine,” Sachs-Kohen said.</p>

<p>For senior music and environmental science and policy major Makayla Bowen-Longino, her decision to not drink is due to the taste, in addition to seeing how it affects people.</p>

<p>“I tried a beer once at a party and I thought it was disgusting, so I haven’t really wanted to try alcohol since then,” Bowen-Longino said. “Also, I see the way it makes people act, like it makes them act stupid. I literally feel like it’s kind of embarrassing to act like that, and I don’t want that to be me.”</p>

<p>While these are all very reasonable rationales for not drinking, the drinkers had their own reasons for why they do choose to partake. But as opposed to the non-drinkers, who each had their own unique and personal reasons for their choices, a couple of the drinkers had pretty similar explanations for why they drink. In addition, all of the drinkers requested to remain anonymous.</p>

<p>The first drinker who I talked to said that they drink simply because they like how it makes them feel, and that it generally results in them having a fun time.</p>

<p>“It just makes me feel good and feel relaxed, and if I’m going out with my friends or something like that, it usually makes me have a little bit of a better time,” they said.</p>

<p>The next drinker who I spoke to echoed the sentiment that it makes them feel good, and even suggested that they use it as a way to make themself feel better if they’re feeling stressed.</p>

<p>“When I drink it usually puts me in a good mood, and makes me happy. And I don’t know if this sounds bad or anything, but sometimes if I’ve had like a bad week, then I’ll look forward to the weekend to be able to drink and kind of just relax from all the stress of the week,” they said.</p>

<p>The last drinker that I spoke to said that their main reason for drinking is that it makes them more social and able to talk to people.</p>

<p>“I would say overall I’m a pretty introverted guy, and if I’m out at a bar or some place with a bunch of people, I would never be able to just go up to a stranger and start talking to them. But if I’m drunk, then it just makes me more social and less nervous and more able to talk to people and meet new people, which is a good thing”, they said.</p>

<p>In addition to comparing their reasonings for why they either drink or don’t drink, I also wanted to collect some quantitative data comparing the two groups. So I asked each individual two different questions in which their answer could theoretically be impacted by whether or not they drink. I asked each person to rate on a scale from 1-100 their general stress level in their life, in addition to rating on a scale from 1-100 how much they enjoy their weekends on average.</p>

<p>And interestingly enough, the drinkers had more positive responses on average for both of the questions compared to the non-drinkers.  The drinkers had an average stress level of just 59.7 compared to 74.3 for the non-drinkers, and the drinkers’ score for how much they enjoy their weekends on average was 85, compared to just 77.3 for the non-drinkers.</p>

<p>Now obviously this is a very small sample size, plus there’s no way to know how directly correlated these numbers actually are with whether or not the students drink, but either way it was interesting to hear the different perspectives.</p>
